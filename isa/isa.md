ISA overview
============

This is a two-address ISA. One of the operands is a memory location or immediate, the other is a register.
The instruction set allows for read-modify-write of either (or both) operands.

NOTE: read-modify-write for core memories is practically free due to the destructive nature of reads. The memory controller doesn't do automatic write-backs (to save a data-register) so the CPU needs to make sure it happens.

Registers
-----------
- R0
- R1
- SP
- PC

Addressing modes
-----------------
- Immediate (sign-extended)
- register-relative
- register-relative immediate

CPU organization
----------------

The CPU is build around an ALU. The ALU has input registers for all of its inputs. These registers are:
- REG_ALU_A
- REG_ALU_B
- REG_ALU_CMD

The output is not registered.

The system bus outputs (address, data, control signals) are also registered.
- REG_BUS_A
- REG_BUS_D
- REG_BUS_CMD

The system bus input (BUS_D) is not registered.

Finally there's the register bank for the 4 registers.
- REG_PC
- REG_SP
- REG_R0
- REG_R1

There's an instruction register holding the currently executing instruction
- REG_INST

The following mode registers are also needed:
- INTDIS: set when interrupts are disabled
- INHIBIT: set when interrupts are inhibited (due to a predicate that disabled the following instruction)
- REG_ICYCLE: a 3-bit counter (or an 8-bit one-hot counter?) to time the execution phases of an instruction



Instruction encoding
---------------------

General instruction format:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|       OPCODE      |    OPB    |  OPA  |         IMMED         |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

OPA codes (i.e. where does the first operand come from):
- 2b00 - PC
- 2b01 - SP
- 2b10 - R0
- 2b11 - R1

OPB input codes (i.e. where does the second operand come from):
- 3b000 - MEM[ IMMED+PC ]
- 3b001 - MEM[ IMMED+SP ]
- 3b010 - MEM[ IMMED+R0 ]
- 3b011 - MEM[ IMMED ]
- 3b100 - IMMED+PC
- 3b101 - IMMED+SP
- 3b110 - IMMED+R0
- 3b111 - IMMED

BINARY group
============

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 0 |    B_OP   | D |    OPB    |  OPA  |         IMMED         |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

B_OP codes:
- 3b000 - SWAP <-- this one is weird as it writes both operands
- 3b001 - OR
- 3b010 - AND
- 3b011 - XOR
- 3b100 - ???
- 3b101 - ADD
- 3b110 - SUB
- 3b111 - ISUB <-- this is inverse sub, i.e. B-A as opposed to A-B

NOTE: SWAP is special in several ways:
- It writes both operands. This means that the 'D' bit is meaningless and can be re-purposed as follows:
  - If 'D' is set to 0, the INTDIS bit is also flipped during execution.
  - If 'D' is set to 1, normal SWAP operation is performed.
- If one of the targets is $PC, it's value is incremented during the swap operation. So for instance SWAP $PC, $R0 is executed with at location 0x1000, $R0 will contain the value $1001 after the instruction finished.
- SWAP between registers is difficult (as it would need to check for the immediate field being 0), so it is not supported.

D codes:
- 1b0 - reg is destination
- 1b1 - memory is destination

Certain operations, such as NOT (XOR with -1) or NEG (0-A) can only be done with register destinations. To implement memory targets, the instruction would need to be surrounded by a pair of SWAPs to get the arguments in their right location.

UNARY group
============

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 0 | U_OP  | D |    OPB    |  OPA  |         IMMED         |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

U_OP codes:
- 2b00 - MOV
- 2b01 - ISTAT <-- stores INT in bit0, INTDIS in bit1
- 2b10 - ROR
- 2b11 - ROL

D codes:
- 1b0 - reg destination; source as well for ROL/ROR
- 1b1 - memory destination; source as well for ROL/ROR

PREDICATE group
===============

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 1 |    P_OP   |    OPB    |  OPA  |         IMMED         |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

in this case, we do all operations as if we were doing a SUB and see what the result would be

P_OP codes:
- 3b000 - ==0
- 3b001 - !=0
- 3b010 - <0  (unsigned)
- 3b011 - >=0 (unsigned)
- 3b100 - <0  (signed)
- 3b101 - >=0 (signed)
- 3b110 - <=0 (signed)
- 3b111 - >0  (signed)

These instructions test the condition and if it is satisfied, set INHIBIT bit. This bit disables interrupts for the next instruction as well as force that instruction to be replaced by a NOP. This allows any instruction to be conditional.

Interrupts and reset
-----------------------

- When an interrupt happens, PC is swapped with the content of address 1. The encoding is such that this is instruction 0x0001.

  Simply put, when an interrupt happens, the INST register is forced to 1 cycle 3. Because of this, the saved PC points to the instruction that needs to be retried once the interrupt handler returns.

  Any SWAP with the 'D' bit cleared also inverts INTDIS. This facilitates return from interrupt operations: in an atomic operation, we restore the execution to where it got interrupted while also enabling interrupts. Interrupts are immediately enabled, so if there's a pending interrupt, no forward progress is made. This is a minor price to pay for simplicity.

- reset is done the same way as interrupts, except that address 0 is used. In other words, on reset, INST is forced to 0x0000 and ICYCLE is forced to 2.

- one can enable/disable interrupts by storing the subsequent location of execution in some convenient low address (something that an IMMED field can address), then performing the requisite SWAP operation (with the D bit cleared). By convention MEM[ 2 ] is used for this purpose.

- The interrupt status as well as the INTDIS bit can be checked by the INT_STAT unary operation.

Pseudo instructions
---------------------

NOP:
- this can be achieved by for example XOR-ing a register with an immediate value of 0.


High level language support
-------------------------------

Function calls and returns:
- The stack frame needs to be prepared by the caller by SP-relative MOV-s (or other means storing the arguments on the stack)
- The return address is stored in the stack by a MOV. This cannot be done directly from the PC Since the PC as that doesn't yet point to the right instruction. There is a special addressing mode (PC+immediate) that can be used to calculate the return address and be stored in a different register, say R1. This value then can be stored in the stack.
- SP is incremented to point to the memory location *after* the return address.
- The function is called by loading its address into the PC.
- The called function allocates its frame on the stack (advancing SP in the process); executed and accesses local variables as well as arguments by SP-relative addressing.
- Prior to return the stack is restored
- The PC is loaded using SP-relative addressing, which returns execution to the caller
- The caller adjusts SP to remove arguments from the stack

Potential optimizations to function calls:
- We could require that arguments are freed by the callee, but that makes variable argument passing convoluted *and* that the return address is put on the stack before all arguments, not after.
- We could pass arguments as well as the return value in registers
- We could even say that R1 is a link register, containing the return address and require the callee to store it in it's own stack-frame, if needed. This, combined with R0 being an argument/return value register could be relatively efficient.

Miscellaneous quirks
------------------------

Arbitrary loads/stores/jumps:
- A full 16-bit immediate can be put in the code segment and loaded in a single instruction using PC-relative addressing. The offsets for these locations are a bit small (+/-32 locations), so one might have to jump over such constant sections to not run out of space. These jumps are also PC-relative (i.e. load PC with PC+IMMED), but that doesn't seem to be a big limitation: we could have 32 long immediates bunched up like that but it's unlikely that there are more than 32 instructions *within* 32 locations away from that section that need long immediates. The overhead seems rather minimal: one extra instruction every 32 or so operations is a 3% penalty.

Special addresses:
- Address 0 (MEM[0]) is the reset vector.
- Address 1 (MEM[1]) is the interrupt vector.
- Address 2 is (by convention) used as a scratch-pad register for enabling/disabling interrupts

Input/Output
-------------

I/O is memory mapped. One thing that needs to be contended with is the pernicious read-modify-write behavior of the CPU. This puts some restrictions on how I/O can be designed.

Many peripheral chips are not friendly to this bus behavior. However, we're talking about a transistor computer, so peripherals are by necessity one-off, custom designs. In that case, this quirk of the CPU bus can be accommodated.
